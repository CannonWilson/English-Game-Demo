# English-Game-Demo

This is a volunteer project I am working on with 2 other volunteers, both artists/designers. 
After witnessing the events in Iraq after US troops left the country, we decided to use our skills
to create an engaging video game to teach English, particularly to those from immigant or refugee backgrounds.

Currently, I am the sole programmer. This is a demo of what we've made so far. A full video can be found here:
